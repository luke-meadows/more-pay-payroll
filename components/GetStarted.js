                Being a customer of Your Pay is easy - we take care of your
                accounting digitally and at a really low price. You run your
                business as you wish, and we fix suitable systems based on your
                conditions. If you want to create your invoices directly in our
                systems, it goes great, and you would rather continue to make
                them e.g. as pdfs, it also works well. Depending on the
                company's size, you can also choose not to receive mail or let
                us handle payments on the company's supplier invoices. Whatever
                you choose to do, you then send in all the material easily with
                our app in your mobile, and then we do the rest. It could not be
                easier!

              <h4>Has your own accounting consultant</h4>
              <p>
                At Your Pay, you always have a dedicated accounting consultant
                who has full control of your company. Your accounting consultant
                is your sounding board for the company's financial issues, and
                despite the fact that we are completely digital in the
                management of your company's finances, we are extremely personal
                when it comes to our relationship with you as a customer. You
                should always feel that you can contact your accounting
                consultant and get answers to all those questions that arise, at
                no extra cost. We are available both by email, phone or over a
                coffee. We simply think this is how it should work at a really
                good accounting firm.

              <p>
                As a customer of Your Pay, you receive a nice and
                easy-to-understand report every month with all the necessary
                information about your company's financial status; income
                statement, balance sheet, accounts receivable and accounts
                payable and a summary of the company's current debt to the
                Swedish Tax Agency. In addition, your accounting consultant
                always gives you a comment on the most important conclusions
                that the figures in the period report tell you about. Here, too,
                we believe in flexibility, because if you are not interested,
                you do not actually need to know everything, we clearly state
                what we have declared for you (because of course we take care of
                it), and how much is to be paid in taxes and VAT.
