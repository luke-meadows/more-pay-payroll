            <h4>You work your way</h4>
            <p>
              Being a customer of Bokoredo is easy - we take care of your
              accounting digitally and at a really low price. You run your
              business as you wish, and we fix suitable systems based on your
              conditions. If you want to create your invoices directly in our
              systems, it goes great, and you would rather continue to make them
              e.g. as pdfs, it also works well. Depending on the company's size,
              you can also choose not to receive mail or let us handle payments
              on the company's supplier invoices. Whatever you choose to do, you
              then send in all the material easily with our app in your mobile,
              and then we do the rest. It could not be easier!

            <h4>Has your own accounting consultant</h4>
            <p>
              At Bokoredo, you always have a dedicated accounting consultant who
              has full control of your company. Your accounting consultant is
              your sounding board for the company's financial issues, and
              despite the fact that we are completely digital in the management
              of your company's finances, we are extremely personal when it
              comes to our relationship with you as a customer. You should
              always feel that you can contact your accounting consultant and
              get answers to all those questions that arise, at no extra cost.
              We are available both by email, phone or over a coffee. We simply
              think this is how it should work at a really good accounting firm.

            <h4>Get a close look at the numbers</h4>
            <p>
              As a customer of Bokoredo, you receive a nice and
              easy-to-understand report every month with all the necessary
              information about your company's financial status; income
              statement, balance sheet, accounts receivable and accounts payable
              and a summary of the company's current debt to the Swedish Tax
              Agency. In addition, your accounting consultant always gives you a
              comment on the most important conclusions that the figures in the
              period report tell you about. Here, too, we believe in
              flexibility, because if you are not interested, you do not
              actually need to know everything, we clearly state what we have
              declared for you (because of course we take care of it), and how
              much is to be paid in taxes and VAT.
